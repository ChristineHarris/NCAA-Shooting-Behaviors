# NCAA-Shooting-Behaviors

In this report, I show that the BigQuery Storage API and the Spark-BigQuery connector can be used to load and analyze the high volume of shooting data available for NCAA Men's Basketball. By running SQL queries on this dataset, I both quantify and visualize general shooting behaviors in the NCAA, as well as shooting trends that have developed over a five-season period. Additionally, I use non-negative matrix factorization to delve deeper into the underlying structure of NCAA player shooting distributions. By analyzing the resulting spatial basis functions, I can draw conclusions about different shot type preferences in the NCAA. By using non-negative matrix factorization as a clustering technique, I categorize players with similar shooting behaviors. Lastly, applying non-negative matrix factorization over several seasons separately, I visualize how shooting preferences have changed over time. The results of this analysis are useful in understanding how NCAA Menâ€™s Basketball has developed over the past decade. These results could also help teams make optimal lineup selections, ensuring that every player is occupying the area on the court where they prefer to shoot.
